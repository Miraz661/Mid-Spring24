  Draw and explain the complete pipeline of an end-to-end ML project.
    .A project pipeline is a defined path of planning, designing and executing a project from start to end. The complete pipeline for a ML project is as follows:-
    Idea/Vision -> Data -> Model -> System =>(Fig 1: Top level pipeline of a ML project)

      Idea/Vision
        Every ML project starts with a vision. This step is all about idealigation of project.
